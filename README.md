###THIS IS A TEST####

# Test 1

Final project for the Building AI course // INMOAI

## Summary

My project is going to be a performance between a friend and me. We want to create an AI which can modify the prices of the buildings. These prices will be affected by the city, the distance to the beach and square meters. We want to make that with the same example of the buildings in the Building AI course. We live in South Europe and the price of the buildings change a lot of times in a year, mostly in summer. So, this is a good tool to obtain the most competitive and real prices. 

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* I want to solve the volatility of the prices in the buildings.
* This problem is higher every year. 
* I love the idea that young people can buy a house. 
* Because we are living a bad situation in the prices of the houses for approx. 10 years ago in Europe.


## How is it used?

The users can choose every characteristic that they want. Moreover, the prices are competitive and more stable.

Images will make your README look nice!


If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
